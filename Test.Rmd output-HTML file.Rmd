#Analsysis of the cars data set in R
##by Su

**Part1**
**these are called Code blocks/chunks**


```{r}
data(cars)
str(cars)
summary(cars)
plot(cars)
```

**Part 2**
```{r}
hist(cars$speed)
boxplot(cars$dist)
```

**Inline R code**
##you can find a value by assigning it `r` and Rmarkdown will find that value for you. 
##Eg. here `r` is the mean which is 15 as we can see in the below console. Instead of manually typing it, Rmarkdown uses that shortcut
The mean speed of cars was `r mean(cars$speed)`


##The end
